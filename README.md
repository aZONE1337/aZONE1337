- 👋 Hi, I’m @aZONE1337
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Java Software Development. 
But despite Java is the most experienced language for me this is still not the only one option! 
Software Development in any of its apperiances is ejoyable for me. 
- 🌱 I’m currently experienced in Spring Framework with its the most common parts such as Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, 
Spring Data JDBC, Spring MVC and so on. I'm also learning some other frameworks, for instance, Hibernate and Kafka. 
But back-end isn't the only thing I'm familiar with, I'm also have some front-end experience in vanila JS and ExtJS framework. 
Moreover, I have some experience in dev-ops tools such as Docker. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning multithreading, developing my problem solving skills and studying algorithms. 
- 💞️ Despite my current experience is highly linked with a web back-end development I'm currently open for any types of collaborations!
- 📫 if you want to contanct me you can send me an e-mail to wbpkkkk@yandex.ru
